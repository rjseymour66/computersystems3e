1A solution  

T<sub>old</sub> = 2500
x = 0.60  
k = 1.5
xT<sub>old</sub> = original performance time
T<sub>old</sub> / k =   

1 / (1 - 0.6) + 0.6 / 1.5 = 1 / .4 + .4 = 1.25  

speedup = 1.25

1B solution

1 / .4 + (.6 / x) = 

To speed up the trip by 1.67, we must decrease the overall time to 15 hours. The parts outside of Montana still require 10 hours, so we must drive montana in 5 hours. That is 300km
