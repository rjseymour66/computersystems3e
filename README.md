# Chapter 1: A Tour of Computer Systems

## 1.1 Information is Bits + Context

Programmers create source programs/files 
- **EVERYTHING IN A COMPUTER IS REPRESENTED BY BITS** source file is a sequence of bits, organized into 8 bit chunks called bytes 
   - context controls whether they represent an integer, char, or machine instruction
- text is represented using ASCII - represents each character with a byte-size value
   - ex: h e l l o = 104 101 108 108 111
   - files w/only ASCII characters are called text files, others are binary files

## Programs are Translated by Other Programs into Different Forms
